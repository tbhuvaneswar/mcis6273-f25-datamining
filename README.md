# MCIS6273 Data Mining Repository

Zotero Username: bhuvaneswar_tenali  

This repository is created for my Fall 2025 Data Mining class.  
It will contain assignments, code, and notes related to the course.  

This is just a sample text to fill the README file.  
I am learning GitHub, Python, and data mining concepts through this class.
